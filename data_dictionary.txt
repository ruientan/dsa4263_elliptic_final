# Elliptic++ Bitcoin Transaction Dataset – Data Dictionary

## 1. Transaction Classes

* **Shape:** (203,769, 2)
* **Purpose:** Labels each transaction as licit, illicit, or unknown.

| Column  | Description                                       |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `txId`  | Unique transaction identifier                     |
| `class` | Transaction class (`licit`, `illicit`, `unknown`) |

---

## 2. Edgelist

* **Shape:** (234,355, 2)
* **Purpose:** Represents the transaction-to-transaction network, where edges indicate Bitcoin flows between transactions.

| Column  | Description             |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| `txId1` | Sender transaction ID   |
| `txId2` | Receiver transaction ID |

---

## 3. Transaction Features

* **Shape:** (203,769, 184)
* **Purpose:** Feature matrix for each transaction, including local features (transaction-specific), aggregate features (graph-level info), and Bitcoin amounts.

### Local Features (1–93)

`Local_feature_1` to `Local_feature_93`: Includes time step, number of inputs/outputs, transaction fee, output volume and aggregated figures such as average BTC received by the inputs/outputs and average number of incoming transactions associated with the inputs/outputs

### Aggregate Features (1–72)

`Aggregate_feature_1` to `Aggregate_feature_72`: Features aggregated over the transaction’s neighborhood in the transaction graph. The features are obtained using transaction information one-hop backward/forward from the center node which gives the maximum, minimum, standard deviation and correlation coefficients of the neighbour transactions for the same information data (number of inputs/outputs, transaction fee, etc.).

| `in_txs_degree`        | Number of incoming transactions (in-degree)  |
| `out_txs_degree`       | Number of outgoing transactions (out-degree) |
| `total_BTC`            | Total Bitcoin transferred in the transaction |
| `fees`                 | Transaction fees                             |
| `size`                 | Transaction size in bytes                    |
| `num_input_addresses`  | Number of input addresses                    |
| `num_output_addresses` | Number of output addresses                   |
| `in_BTC_min`           | Minimum BTC from input addresses             |
| `in_BTC_max`           | Maximum BTC from input addresses             |
| `in_BTC_mean`          | Mean BTC from input addresses                |
| `in_BTC_median`        | Median BTC from input addresses              |
| `in_BTC_total`         | Total BTC from input addresses               |
| `out_BTC_min`          | Minimum BTC sent to outputs                  |
| `out_BTC_max`          | Maximum BTC sent to outputs                  |
| `out_BTC_mean`         | Mean BTC sent to outputs                     |
| `out_BTC_median`       | Median BTC sent to outputs                   |
| `out_BTC_total`        | Total BTC sent to outputs                    |

## 4. Address-to-Transaction Edges

* **Shape:** (477,117, 2)
* **Purpose:** Connects Bitcoin addresses to transactions in which they participate (input or output).

| Column    | Description                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `address` | Bitcoin address                             |
| `txId`    | Transaction ID associated with this address |

---

## 5. Transaction-to-Address Edges

* **Shape:** (837,124, 2)
* **Purpose:** Connects transactions to their output addresses, capturing Bitcoin flow from transactions to addresses.

| Column    | Description            |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| `txId`    | Transaction ID         |
| `address` | Output Bitcoin address |
